Abstract (235 wds)
	In this research, we investigated voters’ mathematical processing of election-related information just before the 2012 (Obama vs. Romney) and 2016 (Trump vs. Clinton) U.S. Presidential Elections. We presented voters with mental math problems based on fictional polling results, and asked participants who they intended to vote for and who they expected to win. We also asked how emotionally invested they were in the preferred candidate winning the election, and how much they liked and agreed with the preferred candidate. We found that committed voters (in 2012 and 2016) arrived at solutions that symmetrically inflated apparent support for the preferred candidate and deflated apparent support for the opponent. Howver, voters who did not expect the candidate they intended to vote for to win (in 2012 and 2016) did not underestimate the opponent’s lead. Identical experiments conducted after the 2012 and 2016 elections revealed that the partisan mathematical biases largely disappeared. 2012 voters’ estimates aligned with election results, with voters underestimating Romney leads and accurately estimating Obama leads. In 2016, biases generally flattened. In sum, results indicate that mathematical processing biases on political polling data are constrained by people’s expectations about the likely or actual state of the world. They also suggest that among people who say they are voting for a candidate, the ones who truly expect that candidate to win could be discerned by the extent of bias in their mathematical processing of polling statistics.
